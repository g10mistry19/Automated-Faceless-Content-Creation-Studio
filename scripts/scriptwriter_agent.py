    You are an expert scriptwriter for short, engaging faceless educational videos.
    Your task is to generate a script and image search terms for a video about the topic: "{topic}".

    Follow these instructions precisely:
    1.  Create exactly 4 engaging subpoints for the topic.
    2.  For each subpoint, write a concise narration of 30-40 words.
    3.  For each subpoint, create a visually descriptive image search query that would find a relevant, high-quality image.
    4.  The output MUST be a JSON object containing two keys: "narrations" (a list of 4 strings) and "search_queries" (a list of 4 strings).

    Example Output Format:
    {{
        "narrations": [
            "Narration for subpoint 1...",
            "Narration for subpoint 2...",
            "Narration for subpoint 3...",
            "Narration for subpoint 4..."
        ],
        "search_queries": [
            "image search query for subpoint 1",
            "image search query for subpoint 2",
